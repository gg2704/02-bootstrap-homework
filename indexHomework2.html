            My name is Gabriel Rene Gonzales. I am from Tucson, AZ. Im currently 19 years old and trying my best to pursue a career un web-development.
             I decided to try out the Univeristy of Arizona's Boot Camp with the intention of putting myself in mentally tough situations because ive 
             always just have been passionate about pushing my limits. Also ive always imagined myself working with technology in someways and felt like
             this would be a good place to start. In the future i would love to have career in web-development and also get into other subjects like game
             design since i love playing video games. I know i might not be the most expierenced in my class or overall but i know that im going to give
             each assignment given to me my all.
